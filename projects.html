  <h1>Pétur Ingi Bache's Projects 2023 - 2024</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my project zone! Here, you'll find a glimpse into the exciting world of making things that I love to explore. From creating 3d Models in CAD software (like Solidworks) to tinkering with electronics and learning about complex machines, I'm always up for a new challenge.</p>

  <h2>The Journey of Making</h2>
  <p>My projects are a journey of exploration and learning.  I use powerful software like Solidworks to design my creations, then translate those designs into reality through various methods like 3D printing, electronics, and even using a lathe. No matter the approach, the process of bringing an idea to life is what excites me most.</p>

  <h2>Current Projects</h2>

    <h3>This Website</h3>
    <p> This website is a long-running endeavor that I'm going to continuously work on. I'm thinking of adding a blog and maybe even a custom domain. If I feel up to it, I might even self-host the website.t</p>

    <h3>Digitizing Family Photos and Setting Up Immich</h3>
    <p>This project has been on the back burner for a while now. I started by digitizing some baby photos of mine. I did that successfully, but I heard that my grandmother had lots of [un-digitized] photos. I offered to digitize them, and she accepted. I haven't started on that yet, as of April 27, 2024.</p>

    <p>I also want to set up Immich for privacy reasons, because Google has a restricted storage plan. I'm hoping to order a Raspberry Pi 5 to run it on, but I'm undecided. For regular updates, you can visit my update page on this project..</p>

  <h2>Previous Adventures in Making</h2>

    <h3>The moaning dinosaur™</h3>
    <p>Walking with a friend, we spotted an electric dinosaur on a chair. I grabbed it, checked its roar function (it worked!), but craved more.</p>
<p>A plan hatched! I had just gotten a funny audio file - a moan - from another friend. "Moaning dinosaur!" I thought. Determined, I ordered a cheap Chinese board that played uploaded audio with a button press. It worked perfectly upon arrival!</p>
<p>Disassembling the dinosaur revealed a seemingly simple setup: a jaw button, speaker, and battery compartment. Wiring it all together went smoothly, but fitting it back in the case proved tricky.</p>
<p>Using Solidworks, I 3D modeled a custom case to fit between the freely-rotating body and tail. After 3D printing, I crammed everything in, screwed it together, and voila - a moaning dinosaur! The battery drains fast, but hey, a moaning dinosaur is worth it, right?</p>

    <h3>My First Solo Lathing Endeavor: A Wooden Ball</h3>
    <p> </p> April 24 2024. This was the first time I used a lathe. I wanted to make a wooden ball, so I asked my woodworking teacher how. He told me that we needed to glue some pieces of wood together. I agreed. I got to work and within 10 minutes I had a big block of wood that needed to dry. The class ended and I went home. Two days later, on the 26 of april 2024. I was back in the shop with my dried wood. The edges of the wooden block were a bit unstraight, so he straightened them in his table saw. From there, he showed me how to do it and then let me take over. I stood there for about an hour carving it to perfection. I got the surface as good as I could. Even though it was less of a ball and more of an egg, I was happy with it. I put some oil on it, took it out of the machine, and went home with a wooden ball (I also forgot my watch at school, which was a bit annoying). </section>

  <h2>Looking Ahead: Future Endeavors</h2>
  <p>The world of making things is vast and ever-evolving. I'm constantly learning new skills and exploring different technologies. Here are some exciting projects I'm looking forward to tackling:</p>
  <ul>
    <h3>A Homemade Fuzz Face Guitar Pedal</h3>
    <p>I've been thinking about this for a while now. I'd order all of the parts, but here's the catch: I'm going to design the case myself in Solidworks and then get it CNC machined from some fancy metal like titanium. </p>
    <h3>Raspberry Pi Nature Camera</h3>
    <p>Raspberry Pi Nature Camera: This project popped into my head after I installed a birdhouse in the garden. I really wanted to be able to look inside whenever I wanted without disturbing the birds. I'd get a Raspberry Pi Zero W (because of the small size and internet connectivity) connect a Raspberry Pi Camera to it, and then either get it to stream an RTSP (Real-time Streaming Protocol) stream viewable through software like Agent DVR or OBS. But I could also install MotionEyeOS because it's simpler. I guess I'll figure that out in the future. (note: the bird house is now getting molested by cats) </p>
